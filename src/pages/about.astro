      <h2>The festival</h2>
      <p>
        Being at KUNE Festival is an immersive experience that blends art,
        music, and the island’s natural beauty. The location’s secludedness adds
        to the sense of separation from everyday life. At the same time, the art
        invites us to engage in open discussions and imagine a world that can be
        different, making a positive impact over our mentality and worldview. <br
        />
        <br /> In conjunction with the art, the music creates a holistic cultural
        experience representative of the modern, young Nordic artistic community.

      <h2>The location</h2>
      <p>
        The island is a decommissioned defense fort built in the 19th century. A
        unique landmark with historical value, the fort-island was recently
        renovated and repurposed into a place dedicated to young people and
        innovative cultural initiatives. It can host 2500 people, 1000 of which
        could be accommodated in the camping area. <br />
        <br /> This unique location provides a striking contrast between its historical
        purpose of aggression and its current function as a hub for a cultural celebration.
